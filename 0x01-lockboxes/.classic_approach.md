The algorithm works by using breadth-first search (BFS) to explore the keys in the boxes and determine whether all the boxes can be unlocked starting from box 0.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the algorithm works:

Initialization:

Create a set keys to keep track of the keys that have been discovered.
Create a queue queue and initialize it with the starting box (box 0).
Breadth-First Search (BFS):

While the queue is not empty, repeat the following steps:
Pop the front element from the queue (current_box).
Check the keys in the current_box:
For each key in the box:
If the key is not in the keys set:
Add the key to the keys set.
Add the key to the end of the queue to explore its connected boxes.
Check for Unlocking:

After the BFS is complete, check if the number of unique keys in the keys set is equal to the total number of boxes.
If they are equal, return True, indicating that all boxes can be unlocked.
If they are not equal, return False, indicating that there are still locked boxes.
Example:

Let's take the third test case as an example (boxes = [[1, 4], [2], [0, 4, 1], [3], [], [4, 1], [5, 6]]):
The algorithm starts with box 0 and explores its keys (1 and 4).
It then adds boxes 1 and 4 to the queue to explore their keys.
The process continues, and the algorithm explores the entire graph of boxes using BFS.
After BFS, it checks if the number of unique keys is equal to the total number of boxes, which is not the case in this example. Therefore, the function returns False.
The BFS ensures that the algorithm explores the keys in the boxes level by level, allowing it to discover all reachable keys and determine if all boxes can be unlocked.


<pre>
def canUnlockAll(boxes):
    # Set to keep track of the keys we have
    keys = set([0])

    # Queue to perform BFS
    queue = [0]

    # Perform BFS
    while queue:
        current_box = queue.pop(0)

        # Check the keys in the current box
        for key in boxes[current_box]:
            if key not in keys:
                keys.add(key)
                queue.append(key)

    # Check if all boxes can be unlocked
    return len(keys) == len(boxes)
